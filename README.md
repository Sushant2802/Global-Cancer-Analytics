# 🌍 Global Cancer Care Analytics

## 📌 Project Vision
This project harnesses the power of **advanced analytics** and **global health data** to uncover actionable insights into cancer care, outcomes, and disparities. Using a robust dataset of **50,000 cancer patient records** collected from multiple countries between **2015 and 2024**, our aim is to bridge the gap between **raw data** and **life-saving decisions**.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview
**File:** `global_cancer_patients_2015_2024.csv`  
The dataset provides a **360° view of cancer patient profiles**, covering:

- **Demographics:** Age, gender, country, year of diagnosis  
- **Genetic & Lifestyle Risks:** Genetic predisposition, smoking, alcohol use, obesity  
- **Environmental Exposure:** Air pollution  
- **Clinical & Economic Variables:** Cancer type, stage, treatment cost  
- **Patient Outcomes:** Survival years, severity scores  

---

## 🎯 Core Objectives

### 🔮 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identify key trends, hidden patterns, and relationships  
- Visualize disparities in diagnosis, lifestyle, treatment, and outcomes  
- Highlight variations across **countries, age groups, and cancer stages**  

### 📈 2. Inferential & Predictive Analytics
Using **statistical analysis & machine learning models**, we aim to:  
- Determine the relationship between **risk factors and cancer severity**  
- Analyze the proportion of **early-stage diagnoses by cancer type**  
- Identify **predictors of cancer severity and survival years**  
- Explore the **economic burden of cancer treatment** across demographics  
- Assess whether **higher treatment cost improves survival outcomes**  
- Examine if **higher stages → greater costs & reduced survival**  
- Study how **genetic risk interacts with smoking** in worsening severity  

### 📝 3. Insight Extraction & Documentation
- Systematically **document all findings**  
- Link insights to **clinical & policy implications**  
- Provide clear, **evidence-backed recommendations**
